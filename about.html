        <h1>About JobTrack</h1>

        <p>
          JobTrack was created to simplify the job search and give job seekers
          clarity, structure, and confidence throughout their career journey.
          Applying for jobs can quickly become overwhelming, applications spread
          across different platforms, missed follow-ups, forgotten interview
          dates, and lost feedback. JobTrack brings everything together in one
          clean, easy-to-use space.
        </p>

        <p>
          With JobTrack, users can track where they've applied, monitor
          application statuses, manage interview schedules, record feedback, and
          stay on top of follow-ups. Instead of relying on spreadsheets, notes,
          or memory, JobTrack helps you stay organized and focused on what
          matters most, progress.
        </p>

        <p>
          JobTrack is built for students, graduates, and professionals at any
          stage of their career who want to approach their job search with
          intention and consistency. Whether you're applying for your first role
          or planning your next career move, JobTrack supports you every step of
          the way.
        </p>
